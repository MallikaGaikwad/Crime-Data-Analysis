The primary dataset utilized in this analysis was sourced from an official government website,
containing incident records of crimes within the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020. It's
important to acknowledge that this dataset is a transcription of original crime reports, which
were initially documented in paper format. Therefore, there may be some potential inaccuracies
in the data due to the manual transcription process. Instances where specific location data was
missing are denoted as (0°, 0°). 

For privacy protection, address information is provided only
up to the nearest hundred block, with exact addresses withheld. It's crucial to recognize that the
data's accuracy depends on the quality of the original records in the database. Any questions or
concerns regarding data quality or specific data points are duly acknowledged and can be
addressed through comments or inquiries.

Furthermore, in preparing the crime dataset, crucial steps were taken, encompassing data
acquisition, thorough inspection, meticulous cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Within this process, any redundant or irrelevant columns, such as URL references and date
records, were pinpointed and subsequently eliminated to optimize the dataset. Additionally, the
feature extraction technique was implemented to extract valuable insights from the available
data. This rigorous data preparation is vital in guaranteeing the dataset's trustworthiness and
pertinence for the comprehensive analysis carried out in this research. It serves as the
fundamental framework upon which the subsequent findings and insights are built.
